Summary: 

Purpose (Why): To explore real-time audio processing techniques and to allow users to express themselves virutally to foster a happier online experience

Main features:
- Visual
    Allow users to pick from a list of default templates of 2D avatars for them to use
    Users can then use these templates to alter their appearance in situations where they would have a webcam on (ex. Discord, Zoom, etc.)
    
    How:
    2D avatars will be created from sprites (images) of PNG characters with multiple facial expressions
    I.E. there will be multiple PNGs of the same sprite with different expressions (mouth closed, mouth open)
    Audio detection will be the trigger that changes the sprite's PNG. (I.E. when audio is detected, the mouth open PNG will appear to simulate the character talking)
    Avatar can be added as a visual source in OBS and the virtual camera OBS feature 

- Audio
    Suppress background noise (e.g. static, breathing, ) (i.e. only allow vocal noise through) 
    Voice activity detection 
    MATLAB's noise processing/detection will be used for the audio features

- UI
    Allows for user to see how each sprite looks
    - option for user to pick their sprite 
    - allow for user to test out the sprite

Secondary features:
- Visual
    Allow users to create their own 2D avatars
    Create more expressions (happy, sad, angry, etc.)

- Audio
    Lower noise spikes (dB range)
